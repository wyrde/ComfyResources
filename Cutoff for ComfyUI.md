Cutoff for ComfyUI

https://civitai.com/models/28295/cutoff-for-comfyui

This is a node based implementation of the [cutoff extension](https://github.com/hnmr293/sd-webui-cutoff) for A1111. Cutoff is a method to limit the influence of specific tokens to certain regions of the prompt. This can be helpful if you want to e.g. specify exactly what colors certain things in the generated image should be.

For a detailed explanation of the method, the introduced nodes, or raise an issue, please see the [github page](https://github.com/BlenderNeko/ComfyUI_Cutoff) for this project. You can take any of the example images listed in the gallery and load them into ComfyUI to have a closer look at an example node tree.

To install simply unzip into the custom_nodes folder.
