Install guide:

    Download

    Uncompress into ComfyUI/custom_nodes

    Restart ComfyUI

Troubleshootings:

    Occasionally, when a new parameter is created in an update, the values of nodes created in the previous version can be shifted to different fields. This can result in unintended results or errors if executed as is, so it is important to check the node values. In particular, when updating from version v1.4 or earlier to version v1.5, all parameter values under guide_size will be different, so be careful when using previously created workflows.
