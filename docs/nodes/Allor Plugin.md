About Allor:

Allure is a plugin for ComfyUI with an emphasis on transparency and performance.
* All modules support transparency, multi-image and are easy to use.
* One of the main features is the ability to combine several images of different sizes.
* Almost all functionality is implemented in tensor space without transformation into an image, where possible. This allows you to achieve an incredible speed of work, in some places the speed increases from 1-2 seconds to 4-6 milliseconds.
