Prompt weighting interpretations for ComfyUI

https://civitai.com/models/46229

Contains a node that lets you set how ComfyUI should interpret up/down-weighted tokens. By default ComfyUI does not interpret prompt weighting the same way as A1111 does. This node lets you switch between different ways in which this is done in frameworks such as ComfyUI, A1111 and compel. It also includes a node that let's you mix CLIP embeddings for some additional customization.

For a detailed explanation of the methods, the introduced nodes, or raise an issue, please see the github page for this project.
