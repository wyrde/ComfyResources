ComfyUI Custom Nodes

https://civitai.com/models/19625/

These files are Custom Nodes for ComfyUI

ComfyUI is a super powerful node-based, modular, interface for Stable Diffusion. I have a brief overview of what it is and does here. And full tutorial content coming soon on my Patreon.

In this model card I will be posting some of the custom Nodes I create. Let me know if you have any ideas, or if there's any feature you'd specifically like to see added as a Node!
