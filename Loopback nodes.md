ComfyUI - Loopback nodes

https://civitai.com/models/26836/comfyui-loopback-nodes

Loop the output of one generation into the next generation.

To use create a start node, an end node, and a loop node. The loop node should connect to exactly one start and one end node of the same type. The first_loop input is only used on the first run. Whatever was sent to the end node will be what the start node emits on the next run.

More loop types can be added by modifying loopback.py
