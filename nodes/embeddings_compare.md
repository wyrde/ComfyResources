# embeddings_compare ComfyUI

* web: https://civitai.com/models/54555/embeddingscompare-comfyui
* repo: 

This is a node setup workflow to compare different textual inversion embeddings in comfyUI.

Use Cases can be comparing of Character likeness embeddings or testing of different strengths of the same embedding.

For testing I am using Emma Watson, Selena Gomez and Wednesday Addams textual inversions, but any other can be put in their place.
