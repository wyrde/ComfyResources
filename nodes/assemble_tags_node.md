2023 04-26 Troubleshooting Instructions:

I am very sorry that I overwrote the code of search path display and selected path display when I packaged yesterday. I just found out today that I have uploaded the code to github and civitail again. If you have downloaded it before and want to use the function of path display, Please download the latest code to overwrite this file ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfy_assemble_tags_node, then go to ComfyUI\web\extensions\select_tags and delete select_tags folder. If you have modified or added your content to tags.xlsx in this folder, please back up and restart ComfyUI

It took me over a week to write. Please give me a star if you like, or give me a star on github

Show Seed:

1. It can be connected to VAE Decode, there are as many KSampler seeds as there are in the process, and you can copy corresponding seeds for use. When we generate images, we think the generated images are pretty good. If we wanted to modify the seeds a little bit, we couldn't get the generated seeds, because the seeds shown in KSampler will generate the next seeds immediately after the call. In this case, you can use this node to solve your needs
