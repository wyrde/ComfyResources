This is a simple copy of the ComfyUI resources pages on [Civitai.com](https://civitai.com/tag/comfyui)

This is meant to be an emergancy source of links and is not meant to be comprehensive or complete. Only the top page of each listing is here.

If you are the owner of a resource and want it removed, do a local fork removing it on github and a PR. (This is the easiest way to authenticate ownership.)

Likewise, if you're the owner of a resource and want to improve the listing, add links, or even an archive, open PRs with the changes. Though in most cases I'd much rather a link to github, huggingfaces, etc be provided rather than releases.

If you know of a resource missing from here, ask the author to open a PR adding it! That'd be awesome. (:





happy nodes,
