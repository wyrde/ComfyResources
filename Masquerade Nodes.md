This is a node pack for ComfyUI, primarily dealing with masks.

Notably, it contains a "Mask by Text" node that allows dynamic creation of a mask from a text prompt.

See full node documentation at https://github.com/BadCafeCode/masquerade-nodes-comfyui

Some example workflows this pack enables are:

    Fine control over composition via automatic photobashing (see examples/composition-by-photobashing.json)

    Inpaint all faces at a higher resolution (see examples/inpaint-faces.json)

    Inpaint all buildings with a particular LORA (see examples/inpaint-with-lora.json)

    Filtering out images/change save location of images that contain certain objects/concepts without the side-effects caused by placing those concepts in a negative prompt (see examples/filter-by-season.json)

Note that you may have to update ComfyUI to be able to inpaint with more than one mask at a time.
